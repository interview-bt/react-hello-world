 * Imagine you wanted to build a system that helps you with task tracking.

 * There is a backend that can fetch task details in JSON format.
 * The available mock APIs are located in "api.ts" file, e.g. getIssue(), getSubtasks()
 *
 * Our exercise is to build a UI that looks like the mockup in jira-issue-mock.png
